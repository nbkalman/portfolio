## Clean NFIP Data
The notebook named clean_NFIP_CA.ipynb cleans data in the zipped json file named output3. 
Unzip the file and put it in the same directory as the notebook, then run the code.

This project was part of my Data Analytics master's capstone, where we picked a dataset of interest to perform a statistical analysis on. I chose the FEMA NFIP dataset because it was related to other work I had done at UC Davis as a GIS Analyst. I am not permitted to share the analysis, but the steps for cleaning the data show some of the skills I learned as Python programmer and data analyst.
